Too often we use our marketing to “propose marriage” to a prospect we’ve just met. When we intentionally structure our marketing to move a prospect seamlessly and subtly toward a great product or service, we win.

Additionally, what happens after a prospect becomes a customer is rarely discussed. Sometimes marketers and owners feel like it’s their job to bring people to the business, not make them come back after their purchase.
